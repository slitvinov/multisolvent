Optional integer field ``color'' is attached to every solvent
particles. Force which acts between a pair of particles: ``A'' and
``B'' can be chosen based on the color of ``A'' and ``B''. For
example if conservative interaction is stronger in ``A'' - ``B'' pair
than in ``A'' - ``A'' and ``B'' - ``B'' pairs effective surface
tension force arises on the surface separation ``A'' and ``B''
region.

\texttt{uDeviceX} is also distinguishes between particles of different
kinds: ``wall'', ``RBC'', ``solvent'', ``solid''. The difference
between ``colors'' and ``kinds'' is that colors can be assigned
dynamically. Both ``kind'' and ``color'' can by used to choose between
different forces. For example, in pair ``solid'' - ``wall'' strong but
short range repulsive interaction is used.

See~\ref{a:color} for the details of how to use colors.
